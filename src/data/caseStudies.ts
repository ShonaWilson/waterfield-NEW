    content: `Royal Agricultural Society of NSW, a large and established organisation, recognised the growing need to integrate AI into their operations but were uncertain where to begin.

They required a clear governance framework to align AI use with their business objectives and ensure responsible management. Additionally, RAS sought support to drive AI adoption across teams, ensuring consistent practices and a shared strategic direction for AI use throughout the organisation.

## Process

Our approach began with equipping RAS with a comprehensive understanding of AI and its transformative potential. Through hands-on workshops, we designed and facilitated a tailored governance framework to ensure responsible AI use while boosting confidence in adoption.

An internal pilot team was promptly established to test and refine AI applications, supported by an oversight committee to share key insights and drive accountability.

To sustain momentum, a Community of Practice was created, empowering the organisation to foster AI expertise and scale learning across teams, with a focus on building internal capability and expertise.

## Outcome

RAS achieved a deeper understanding of AI's applications, with staff gaining clarity on where and how to use it effectively, ultimately saving a vast amount of time and allowing teams to focus on higher-value initiatives.

A robust governance framework was successfully implemented, ensuring responsible AI use across the organisation. Key insights from the pilot team were shared organisation-wide, fostering scalable learning and promoting continuous improvement.

Today, RAS operates with assured capability, confidently extending AI safely across their operations with a shared strategic direction for future AI initiatives.

> "The progress we've made in a short period has been remarkable. AI Advantage provided us with the structure and confidence we needed, offering a clear process and governance guardrails for the safe and ethical use of AI."

    content: `A proposition had percolated for a number of years for a comprehensive cancer centre to create a powerful alliance of successful Victorian organisations committed to cancer control.

These included The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne Health (including The Royal Melbourne Hospital), The University of Melbourne, the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, The Royal Women's Hospital, The Royal Children's Hospital, Western Health and St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne.

## Process

Waterfield was engaged as an independent facilitator to design and facilitate a process to bring all parties to an agreement on how to structure and govern this complex entity.

A custom alliance facilitation was developed to ensure all stakeholders were onboard and engaged to efficiently collaborate together for a joint outcome and future success.

## Outcome

The business case was signed off by the Victorian State Government and successfully joint funded by the State and Federal Governments for $1.0 Billion.

The Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre concept, structure and governance model was collectively developed and agreed by all parties. The VCCC is a powerful alliance of ten Victorian organisations committed to cancer control successfully specialising in integrated cancer research and patient care.

    content: `CareerTrackers is a national non-profit organisation that creates internship opportunities for Indigenous university students.

In addition to making long-lasting placements, CareerTrackers provides a wide spectrum of support to help prepare students for leadership in the workplace and the community.

## Process

As a non-profit organisation, CareerTrackers' biggest challenge was to build trust and credibility, not only with corporations but with the indigenous community and students.

A barrier to this is the reliance on government funding to move the organisation forward. It would essentially mean that every year or so, they would need to apply for the funding. This stop start approach would not allow them to plan effectively for a long term future. This longevity was paramount to gaining trust within the indigenous community.

## Outcome

The team came up with an idea to get one company to sign a ten-year partnership. This would go a long way to securing the future of the organisation. With the support of Waterfield, the team were pushed to realise an even greater outcome that would cement the path for CareerTrackers to build long lasting relationships with students.

A plan for a 10x10 commitment from companies was established, which led to CareerTrackers becoming a sustainable organisation that can really make a difference.

> "...People have come to see CareerTrackers as a brand of excellence, a brand of holding true to what we say we're going to do and what we actually do. Waterfield has been so important in delivering on that promise."

    content: `The Marrakesh Treaty was formulated in Morocco to allow copyright exception and aid the creation of books and other copyright material in accessible formats for the visually impaired, with Australia being one of the signatories.

The Australian Publishers' Association, represent a large array of publishing businesses, identified the importance of collaboration in rolling out the implications of the Treaty. Two Australian forums were held with representatives from the Department of Education, libraries, publishers, authors and literary agents, people with disability as well as the Copyright Agency and the Australian Digital Alliance attending. Each with unique views on the copyright debate.

## Process

The team at Waterfield were engaged to facilitate these forums with the Australian Publishers Association. Waterfield's unique approach to facilitation allowed the goals and outcomes to be established and agreed upon by those most affected by the implications of the Treaty.

Gaining consensus in a collaborative process with these key groups of representatives paved an agreed approach forward to implementing the Marrakesh Treaty in Australia which was the key objective. Along with an agreed way forward, Waterfield's strategic approach also enabled the group to rapidly map key actionable outcomes forming a clear vision of what needed to happen next to drive this project forward.

## Outcome

An exciting strategic outcome of 'defining the book of the future' is certainly coming to fruition. In the next 12 months, the forum has committed to a set of outcomes and strategic investments. This includes the publication of a plain English guide to accessibility standards as well as piloting 10 titles of different types of publications carrying the new standards.

The organisations involved in the forum are now taking a proactive rather than reactive approach to redefining the book of the past into something much more accessible for the visually impaired, those with literacy and language difficulties, moving to a more inclusive approach to publishing knowledge and information.

> "Waterfield have been critical in the success of the Marrakesh Treaty Forum. Waterfield's rapid consensus methodology was the perfect means of bringing together disparate organisations and uniting them under one clear aim- to increase accessible content for the print disabled."

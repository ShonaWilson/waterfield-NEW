— Sherlock Holmes

Most organisations resist this kind of thinking. They acknowledge the past was different, yet plan as if the present will persist indefinitely.

This is the trap. And foresight is the way out.

Foresight isn't about fortune-telling. It's not even about being right about what's coming. It's about building awareness—noticing the droplets now so you're not blindsided by the waterfall later.

In this article, we unpack the mindset shift required—and the practical tools that make foresight actionable:

- The "end of history" illusion
- A simple tool: –10 / +10 trend analysis
- From foresight to action
- Scenario planning and no-regret moves
- Building foresight as a continuous capability

## The "End of History" Illusion

Most organisations operate under a comforting but dangerous assumption: that today's conditions will more or less persist into the future.

Psychologists call this the "end of history" illusion. We recognise how much has changed in the past, yet we consistently underestimate how much will change going forward. We plan as if the present is permanent.

It isn't.

Consider one simple, unavoidable assumption: in 10 years, you'll be 10 years older.

So will your partner. Your children. Your parents. Your colleagues. Your customers.

That single deduction reshapes demand patterns, workforce expectations, health needs, spending behaviour, and leadership transitions. And yet, many organisations avoid this kind of reasoning altogether—defaulting instead to short-term plans built on static assumptions.

## A Simple Tool: –10 / +10 Trend Analysis

To help leadership teams break free from static thinking, we use a straightforward exercise called –10 / +10 trend analysis.

The approach is simple:

1. What was true 10 years ago?
2. What is true now?
3. What is almost certainly different 10 years from now?

When you plot even a few external trends this way—demographic shifts, technology adoption, regulatory direction, workforce expectations—it becomes obvious: expecting the future to flatline at today's settings is a mistake.

## How It Works in Practice

We bring leadership teams together around a timeline map. First, the group reflects collectively on the past—charting what was true 10 years ago across the dimensions that matter most to their organisation.

Then we map the present. What's shifted? What's emerging? What's accelerating?

From there, the team begins to imagine the timeline forward—not as a prediction exercise, but as a collective act of reasoning. What patterns are likely to continue? What disruptions are already in motion? What assumptions are we making without realising it?

The power isn't in any single insight. It's in the shared awareness that emerges—and the better questions that follow.

## From Foresight to Action

Once an organisation articulates an anticipated future, something powerful happens.

You can look back from that future horizon and ask:

- What really matters?
- Which levers do we need to pull?
- What capabilities must we build now to stay on purpose and future-ready?

This is the essence of backcasting—starting with a plausible future state and working backward to identify the actions required today. It shifts the strategic conversation from reactive ("What should we do about this quarter's results?") to proactive ("What must we become to thrive in the world that's emerging?").

## Going Deeper: Scenario Planning

For organisations facing significant uncertainty, more advanced foresight approaches can add further value.

Scenario planning doesn't attempt to predict a single future. Instead, it explores multiple plausible futures—each based on different assumptions about how key uncertainties might unfold.

The goal isn't to pick the "right" scenario. It's to identify no-regret moves: actions that strengthen the organisation regardless of which future materialises. And to stress-test current strategies against a range of possibilities, rather than a single implicit bet.

Scenario planning builds strategic resilience. It helps organisations prepare for surprise rather than being blindsided by it.

## Foresight as a Continuous Capability

Here's the critical shift: foresight isn't a one-off strategy exercise. It's a continuous capability.

The organisations that thrive in complexity aren't those with the most accurate predictions. They're the ones that build foresight into their rhythm—regularly scanning the horizon, updating assumptions, and adapting their strategies accordingly.

This means:

- **Embedding foresight into planning cycles**—not just annual strategy offsites, but quarterly check-ins on emerging trends and signals.
- **Building organisational awareness**—encouraging teams at all levels to notice and share weak signals before they hit the mainstream.
- **Creating adaptive strategies**—designing plans with built-in flexibility, so the organisation can pivot as conditions evolve.

## Thriving in Uncertainty

The future is not a fixed destination. It's a landscape of possibilities, shaped by forces already in motion.

Foresight gives organisations the ability to see those forces clearly, reason about their implications, and act with intention rather than reaction. It transforms uncertainty from a threat into a source of strategic advantage.

At Waterfield, we help leadership teams build foresight into their strategic practice—moving from static plans to adaptive, future-ready strategies. Whether through –10 / +10 trend analysis, scenario planning, or embedding continuous foresight into your planning rhythm, the goal is the same: leaders who see clearly and act decisively.

## See the Waterfall Before It Arrives

What "drops of rain" are you noticing right now that hint at a much bigger waterfall ahead?

The signals are there. The question is whether your organisation is equipped to read them—and ready to act.`,

    content: `What do fruit flies and successful organisations have in common? Both thrive on collaboration. From tiny insects to complex human brains, a universal principle emerges: shared effort and coordination unlock extraordinary results.

Now imagine if your organisation embraced this level of collaboration—and amplified it with AI. The possibilities are transformative. Collaboration, enhanced by AI, is no longer optional; it's the key to navigating complexity, driving innovation, and achieving impactful outcomes.

## Collaboration: The Foundation of Success

The human brain devotes nearly 50% of its resources to collaboration—coordinating activity, sharing information, and ensuring systems work together effectively. This universal principle helps species adapt and thrive, from fruit flies to humans. Why should organisations operate any differently?

## Collaboration as a Strategic Advantage

Collaboration isn't just a helpful practice—it's the backbone of success. Organisations that prioritise collaboration achieve:

- **Stronger Solutions:** Diverse input enriches decisions and reduces blind spots.
- **Faster Results:** Aligned teams can execute with agility and precision.
- **Resilience:** Collaborative cultures adapt more effectively to change.

But collaboration doesn't happen by accident. It requires intention, the right tools, and a culture that fosters trust and alignment.

## AI: Amplifying Human Potential

Artificial Intelligence can do more than crunch numbers and words. In today's workplaces, AI is used to automate repetitive tasks, analyse customer feedback, predict market trends, and personalise marketing efforts. From virtual assistants scheduling meetings to AI-powered tools drafting reports, AI is increasingly woven into our day-to-day work.

But here's the key—AI works best as a thinking partner, not a replacement. At Waterfield, we promote a human-centred approach to AI, reminding clients that they are the subject matter experts. AI should augment human intelligence, not overshadow it.

## How AI Enhances Collaboration

- **Sharper Focus:** AI processes vast amounts of data to surface critical insights, helping teams concentrate on high-value work.
- **Improved Decision-Making:** By revealing patterns and overcoming biases, AI elevates the quality of decisions.
- **Time Savings:** AI automates routine tasks, freeing teams to engage in creative problem-solving.

Imagine an AI tool that analyses customer feedback in real time, allowing your team to adjust strategies quickly. Or consider AI-driven project management software that streamlines workflows and enhances team coordination. How could these technologies unlock your team's potential?

## Empowering Organisations through Collaborative Intelligence

At Waterfield, collaboration isn't just a practice—it's a guiding principle. For over 30 years, we've helped organisations create environments where teams share insights, build trust, and achieve transformative results. While individual expertise is important, it's team collaboration that truly drives progress and builds resilience.

> "The smartest person in the room, is the room."

We are at the forefront of an evolving approach we refer to as **Collaborative Intelligence**—combining Collective Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence for better outcomes. We see this as the future of work, helping clients navigate complexity, align teams, and elevate strategic capability.

## The Synergy of Collective Intelligence and AI

The most powerful results come when human creativity meets AI's capabilities. This collaboration—known as **Collaborative Intelligence**—blends:

- **Human Strengths:** Intuition, ethical judgment, and contextual understanding.
- **AI Strengths:** Pattern recognition, rapid analysis, and scalability.

![Collaborative Intelligence](/ai-collaboration.jpg.avif)

## Elevating Strategic Capabilities

Collaborative Intelligence isn't just about efficiency—it's about transformative outcomes. Benefits include:

- **Overcoming Bias:** AI challenges assumptions, bringing objectivity to the table.
- **Simplifying Complexity:** AI synthesises data into actionable insights that inform strategy.
- **Aligning Teams:** Shared understanding creates alignment, helping teams achieve meaningful goals.

By combining these strengths, organisations can make better decisions, innovate more effectively, and navigate complexity with confidence.

## The Future of Collaboration

As the world continues to evolve rapidly, the importance of collaboration will only grow. Emerging technologies, global interconnectedness, and increasingly complex challenges demand that organisations work smarter, not just harder.

## Looking Ahead

The future of collaboration lies in embracing Collaborative Intelligence at all levels. This means not only within teams but across entire organisations and even industries. By fostering a culture that values both human insight and technological advancement, organisations can stay ahead of the curve.

At Waterfield, we are committed to helping clients prepare for this future by:

- **Developing Adaptive Strategies:** Assisting in creating plans that are flexible and responsive to change.
- **Building Collaborative Cultures:** Promoting environments where open communication and shared goals are the norm.
- **Leveraging Advanced Technologies:** Guiding clients in adopting AI tools that enhance rather than replace human capabilities.

## Thriving in Complexity with Collaboration + AI

Collaboration and AI aren't just tools—they are essential strategies for navigating today's fast-paced, complex world. By embracing Collaborative Intelligence, your organisation can unlock new levels of innovation, alignment, and resilience.

At Waterfield, we help organisations harness the power of AI and Collective Intelligence to achieve meaningful outcomes. Whether it's driving smarter strategies, simplifying complexity, or aligning teams, the future belongs to those who collaborate smarter.

    excerpt: "Understanding the balance between operational excellence and strategic innovation.",
    date: "2024-11-04",
    image: "/articles/2.jpeg.avif",
    author: "Kevin Nuttall",
    content: `Creating a strategic plan that propels your organisation forward requires a clear distinction between operational imperatives and strategic choices.

Roger Martin, a renowned strategy author whose work I closely follow, provides a valuable framework to achieve this clarity. Here, I'd like to share his insights and how we apply them at Waterfield to ensure our clients' strategies are both truly strategic and actionable.

## Operational Imperatives vs Strategic Choices

Martin offers a simple yet powerful test to differentiate between operational imperatives and strategic choices: ask yourself, **"Is it stupid not to do it?"** If the answer is yes, then it's an operational imperative—essential and non-negotiable. For example, ensuring the safety of your workers is an operational imperative.

In contrast, a strategic choice involves deciding among various viable options. Consider a construction company that offers a ten-year guarantee on its buildings, exceeding the standard seven-year legislative requirement. This is a strategic choice because it's one possible path among many reasonable options.

## An Easy Analogy

- **Operational Imperatives:** Keep the car running smoothly.
- **Strategic Choices:** Decide where the car is headed.

## The Importance of Creativity and Uniqueness

When making strategic choices, focus on creativity and uniqueness to carve out a distinct market position. Operational imperatives, on the other hand, should be about replication—adopting and implementing best practices observed elsewhere.

## Limit Your Strategic Choices

Martin also emphasises the importance of limiting strategic choices—an approach we strongly believe fosters focused outcomes and have seen succeed firsthand with our clients. By narrowing focus to three to five strategic choices, while allowing five to ten operational imperatives, we've seen this balance greatly enhance the effectiveness and clarity of our clients' strategies.

## The 60/40 Ratio in Practice

At Waterfield, we've conducted thousands of strategy development projects over the past three decades. Analysing our last 100 strategic assignments, we observed a consistent 60/40 ratio of operational imperatives to strategic choices, aligning closely with Martin's insights.

![Applying the 60/40 Ratio](/strategy-60-40-ratio-1.png.avif)

## Applying the 60/40 Ratio to Your Strategic Plan

To ensure your strategic plan is balanced and truly strategic, we recommend examining it through the lens of the 60/40 ratio. Here's how:

1. **Audit Your Plan:** List all elements of your strategic plan and categorise them as either operational imperatives or strategic choices.
2. **Assess the Balance:** Check if your plan aligns with the 60/40 ratio. Too many operational imperatives may indicate a robust operation but lack clear strategic direction. Conversely, an excess of strategic choices can scatter your efforts and hinder goal achievement.
3. **Adjust Accordingly:** If your plan deviates from the 60/40 ratio, consider re-evaluating the elements. Are there operational tasks masquerading as strategic choices? Or are there too many strategic options diluting your focus?

## Avoid Strategy-Operations Confusion

Often, what is labelled as strategic planning is actually operational improvement—fine-tuning existing processes rather than making strategic choices that will propel your business forward. The 60/40 ratio helps distinguish between these two, ensuring your strategy is genuinely strategic.

## Achieving Balance for Success

The 60/40 ratio is more than just a guideline; it's a valuable test for assessing the alignment of your strategy with its potential for successful implementation. Deviations from this ratio should prompt a deeper examination of your strategy's logic and its ability to meet organisational goals.

By balancing strategic choices with operational imperatives, you can create a strategic plan that is both visionary and executable, driving your organisation toward sustained success.

By creating Interactive Futures, we're helping businesses engage with future scenarios to enhance strategic thinking, navigate uncertainty, and turn it into decisive action.

**In this article, we will delve into:**

- The Challenge of Thinking Ahead
- The Power of Interactive Futures
- Positive Impacts on Strategic Thinking
- Strategic Advantage with AI

## The Challenge of Thinking Ahead

In today's fast-paced business environment, leaders face countless "What if?" scenarios:

- What if market conditions shift dramatically?
- What if emerging technologies disrupt our industry?
- What if consumer preferences change unexpectedly?

These uncertainties can stall decision-making, often due to a mental bias known as the 'Illusion of the End of History.' If I were to ask you to recount the past 10 years, you'd likely list numerous significant events, both expected and unexpected. However, if I ask you to predict the next 10 years, you might expect more of the same — this is where the illusion comes into play.

This cognitive dissonance serves as a safety mechanism, shielding us from the volatility of an unpredictable future. However, it becomes a hurdle when you're trying to envision and create a preferred future for your organisation.

![Interactive Futures](/interactive-futures-1.png.avif)

Waterfield believes the key to overcoming this challenge lies in strategic foresight — anticipating future challenges and opportunities to make better decisions today. Yet, with so many variables at play — technological advancements, shifting market dynamics, and evolving consumer preferences — traditional strategy development often falls short.

This is where Interactive Futures come in. By creating a virtual model that replicates your real-world organisation, we can simulate various future scenarios, allowing you to engage with potential outcomes and refine your strategic thinking.

Imagine asking your future organisation:

- What strategic decisions were most pivotal to our success?
- Which partnerships delivered the greatest value to our customers?
- How can I evolve from my current role to achieve my future aspirations?

These aren't just speculative exercises; they're opportunities to explore different pathways, challenge assumptions, and prepare for the road ahead. By interacting with an Interactive Future, you can move beyond "What if?" and actively shape "What's next?"

## The Power of Interactive Futures

At its core, an Interactive Future is a digital twin of your business, powered by AI. This model reflects the complexities of your organisation and its environment, allowing you to rigorously test strategies in a risk-free setting. The insights gained from these simulations can be transformative, offering several key benefits:

- **Enhanced Strategic Foresight:** By engaging in conversations with your future organisation, you gain a deeper understanding of potential developments and their implications. This foresight helps you craft strategies that are not only responsive but also proactive.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Interactive Futures can process vast amounts of data, identifying trends and correlations that traditional analysis might miss, helping lead to more informed decisions.
- **Innovative Experimentation:** The synthetic environment encourages bold, unconventional experimentation. Since these tests are conducted in a virtual space, the risks are minimised, allowing for creative exploration that could lead to breakthrough strategies.
- **Agility and Resilience:** In today's volatile environment, agility is key. By simulating various scenarios, you can identify potential risks and develop contingency plans, ensuring your organisation stays resilient in the face of unexpected challenges.

![Positive Impacts](/interactive-futures-2.jpg.avif)

## Positive Impacts on Strategic Thinking

One of the most powerful aspects of engaging with an Interactive Future is how it shifts strategic thinking. These aren't predictions but rather conversations with a possible future version of your organisation.

Why is this valuable? It provokes thought, offering three key responses:

- **Confirmation:** Reinforcing your current strategies.
- **Refinement:** Fine-tuning your approach based on new insights.
- **Challenges:** Questioning assumptions and encouraging deeper analysis.

As you engage in these conversations, your initial assumptions may be challenged, leading to a refinement of your strategies. This iterative process promotes deeper analysis and more robust planning, aligning your strategies with both current realities and future possibilities.

This isn't just about preparing for one possible future, but about being ready for a range of outcomes.

## Strategic Advantage with AI

We see AI as a tool for empowerment, helping you make more informed decisions that benefit both your organisation and your people. Interactive Futures embodies this philosophy, providing a practical and effective way to navigate the complexities of modern business.

We're excited to bring this innovative approach to our clients, offering the tools and insights needed to succeed in an unpredictable world. By starting the conversation with your future organisation today, you ensure that your strategies are not just reactive but proactive, positioning your business for sustained success.

    image: "/articles/4.jpg.avif",
    author: "Kevin Nuttall",
    content: `In the fast-paced world of business, staying ahead often means seeing what others don't. This is where the concept of testing for weak signals comes into play, and why the unassuming TV Detective Columbo's method might just be invaluable to improving your overall business strategy.

Recently, the question we're hearing from our clients is, "How do we continually scan the external environment for opportunities and challenges?" In this article, we answer this question by breaking down the following:

- Understanding Weak Signals
- The Columbo Method
- Continuous Environmental Scanning
- Real-World Application

## Understanding Weak Signals

Weak signals are early indicators of emerging trends, changes, or potential disruptions in your industry or market. They're called "weak" because they're often subtle and easily overlooked. Think of them as the first ripples on a pond before a big wave hits. Detecting these signals can give your business a significant competitive advantage.

Characteristics of weak signals include:

1. **Subtlety:** They're not obvious at first glance.
2. **Potential significance:** Though small, they can precede major shifts.
3. **Ambiguity:** Their full implications may not be immediately clear.
4. **Early stage:** They appear before a trend becomes widely recognised.

Examples of weak signals might include:

- A small but growing demand for a new type of product
- Subtle shifts in customer behaviour or preferences
- Emerging technologies not yet mainstream
- Changes in regulations in adjacent industries

## The Columbo Method: A Tool to Detect Weak Signals

Enter Detective Columbo, the seemingly absent-minded investigator known for his unassuming manner and knack for asking the right questions at the right time.

We have taken Columbo's method and applied his approach to business strategy creating Waterfield's easy to remember ASK framework:

**A - Assign:** Give everyone in your organisation a question to ask customers, suppliers, delivery people, etc, every month.

**S - Scan:** Gather and review all the responses.

**K - Know:** Identify patterns and potential weak signals in the collected data.

![Columbo Method](/columbo-method-1.png.avif)

Why It Works:

- Builds trust through a friendly, unassuming approach
- Establishes rapport through casual conversation
- Encourages open, honest responses in a relaxed atmosphere

The key is to strike the right balance: build trust, establish rapport through natural conversation, then ask a thoughtful, well-timed question when the person feels comfortable and at ease.

Empowering all staff to ask similarly themed questions and aggregating their findings can significantly enhance your understanding and anticipation of the external environment.

## Continuous Environmental Scanning

Using the ASK framework forms a system of continuous environmental scanning. This ongoing process helps you:

- Detect weak signals early
- Identify emerging trends before competitors
- Anticipate potential disruptions to your industry
- Discover new opportunities for innovation or expansion

By regularly engaging with various stakeholders in casual, open-ended conversations, you create multiple touchpoints for gathering diverse insights. Over time, patterns may emerge that point to significant upcoming changes in your business landscape.

## Real-World Application

Imagine a logistics company using this method. Through casual conversations, they might detect:

- Increasing mentions of sustainable packaging from various clients
- Growing interest in same-day delivery among smaller retailers
- Subtle shifts in seasonal storage needs across different industries

These weak signals could lead to strategic decisions like investing in eco-friendly packaging solutions, developing a same-day delivery service for small businesses, or optimising warehouse space for seasonal fluctuations.

![Strategic Advantage](/columbo-method-2.png.avif)

## From Subtle Clues to Strategic Advantage

In an era of information overload, the ability to detect weak signals can be a game-changer. The Columbo Method using the ASK framework offers a structured yet casual approach to gathering these crucial insights.

By channelling your inner Columbo – being observant, asking the right questions, and paying attention to the subtle details – you can stay ahead of industry trends and make informed strategic decisions. Seemingly minor details could signal a broader market trend, allowing your company to gain a first-mover advantage.

> **Key takeaway:** The goal is to gather honest responses through continual and casual conversations with your customers, suppliers, delivery people and broader network to pick up signals and gain insights.

Remember, as Columbo would say, "There's just one more thing..." – the power of this method lies in its consistency and your ability to connect the dots over time.

Start implementing the ASK framework in your business strategy today, and watch as those weak signals transform into your roadmap for future success.`,

    excerpt: "Why strategic planning matters in a world of constant change.",
    date: "2024-04-08",
    image: "/articles/5.jpg.avif",
    author: "Kevin Nuttall",
    content: `The fact is we live in an unpredictable world. The belief that setting a strategy in isolation from the external world and potential future changes is flawed.

A successful strategy is robust, ready to evolve organisation-wide and adjust to external factors that will impact your business.

Here are 3 valuable ways we recommend you strategically embrace an unpredictable future:

1. **Outside-world thinking**
2. **Create a hypothesis**
3. **Act and Adapt**

## 1. Outside-world thinking

**The world around us is dynamic and ever-changing.** Acknowledging this empowers us to make informed decisions based on real-world conditions.

*For example:* Generative AI; this is a hot topic that we are helping clients embrace and keep ahead of the curve. In terms of strategic planning and awareness of external factors, OpenAI released GPT-3 in June 2020. In those few years there are now more AI assisted tools integrated into various product offerings than can be listed.

This space is revolutionary and changing everyday; understanding how this impacts your sector and external landscape will help guide future decision-making.

## 2. Create a hypothesis

**Success hinges on developing and refining your best hypothesis about the future landscape.** It involves leveraging foresight and the resulting insights to navigate potential challenges and opportunities effectively.

*How this works:* The first step in our strategy development process is teaching clients how to foresight and build this into an on-going capability to help actively anticipate the future. This is an exploratory process where the team gathers information to gain insights which better informs decision making.

With this pre-work and knowledge, the next step is to state a hypothesis on what will allow your organisation to be future-ready.

The description (hypothesis) of your organisation in 3 to 5 years time typically covers seven main areas, we refer to them as the 7P's:

1. **Profile** - the positioning and profile of your organisation
2. **Product** - the product or service you will be offering
3. **Place** - where you operate and to whom
4. **People** - the skills, workforce and culture to enable the organisation
5. **Partners** - who you need alliances with to create more value for your customers or beneficiaries
6. **Process** - the processes and system backbone to scale the organisation
7. **Performance** (or Profit) - the result desired from the collective effort

## 3. Act and Adapt

**Agility is paramount.** Acting swiftly on your strategy and adapting as needed ensures relevance and resilience in the face of uncertainty.

This means finding the:

- Fastest
- Lowest risk
- Cheapest

way to test your hypothesis.

*For example:* To test a new product or service idea, you can offer a minimum viable product to your existing customers to see if they resonate with it. If the feedback is positive, continue; if it is negative or only lukewarm, reconsider your hypothesis and re-calibrate your approach.

## Meaningful strategy

**At the end of the day, a strategy sets a clear direction for your organisation's growth that everyone understands and delivers towards.** Effectively anticipating factors outside of your organisation's control and being prepared to act will add to your ability to achieve this outcome.

To radically embrace an unpredictable future remember to:

1. Think beyond the lens of just your organisation to understand the world around you
2. Make a hypothesis on how to best tackle potential future challenges in order to create opportunities
3. Act swiftly, ready to make adjustments to remain relevant in a fast changing business environment.

Waterfield guides enterprises across these three areas to strategically thrive in an unpredictable future to become leaders in their industry.`,

    slug: "why-a-perfect-strategy-is-a-myth",
    title: "Why a perfect strategy is a myth",
    excerpt: "Embracing adaptability over perfection in strategic planning.",
    date: "2023-12-01",
    image: "/articles/6.jpeg.avif",
    author: "Kevin Nuttall",
    content: `The persistent idea of a perfect strategy is a myth. The notion that a strategy can be devised to anticipate all future outcomes and provide a perfect solution to any problem is simply unfeasible.

**To write the perfect strategy, you would need to have perfect foresight into the future, which sounds incredible, but unreal.**

## Let's be realistic

The future is unpredictable and is constantly changing, making it impossible to create the perfect strategy.

An organisation's strategy is essentially a **hypothesis of how to prosper in an anticipated future environment.** This means that the strategy is based on:

- Assumptions about what the future will look like
- Assumptions about how the organisation can best position itself to take advantage of those conditions

Since the future is unpredictable, these assumptions will likely be inaccurate, and the strategy will need to be adapted as new information becomes available.

## Why create a strategy at all?

The fact that a perfect strategy is unattainable does not mean that a strategy is not necessary. On the contrary, having **a strategy is an essential learning tool for any organisation that wants to succeed in a highly competitive environment.**

> "Plans are worthless, but planning is everything." - Dwight D. Eisenhower

A strategy provides a roadmap, outlining goals, objectives, and steps needed to achieve them. It helps the organisation focus resources and make better decisions by providing a framework for evaluating different options. However, it is important to recognise that **a strategy is not a fixed document; it needs continuous testing and adaptation as future realities reveal themselves.**

## Design an adaptive strategy through foresighting

Rather than pursuing perfection, the goal is adaptability. **Organisations need to be agile and flexible, capable of responding quickly to changes in the environment.**

Regular foresighting exercises, like scenario planning, can help ensure an organisation's strategy remains relevant. Scenario planning involves developing different scenarios for the future, assessing how well the organisation's strategy would perform under each, identifying potential risks and opportunities, and determining 'no regret moves' irrespective of the future scenario.

## Build a robust strategy through collaboration

Another important aspect of developing a successful strategy is to involve a range of stakeholders in the process. This includes strategic foresighting, setting a clear direction and implementing it; what we like to call 'bringing the strategy to life'.

Involving not just senior executives, but also employees, customers, suppliers, and other external stakeholders allows for a wider range of perspectives, which **helps develop a more complete understanding of the external environment organisations operate in.**

This collaborative engagement provides more diverse and informed inputs in creating and executing a robust growth strategy.

## Anticipate and adapt with a changing world

While a perfect strategy may be a myth, having a strategy is essential for any organisation aiming to succeed in a highly competitive environment.

Essentially, a **strategy is a hypothesis on how to thrive in an anticipated future environment, and it requires continuous testing and adaptation as future realities unfold.**

By embracing agility and flexibility and involving a diverse range of stakeholders in the process, organisations can develop a more robust strategy, significantly optimising long-term success.

## Waterfield's approach

Waterfield's approach to helping organisations create and execute a clear Strategy Map follows the principles of *Foresight, Insight and Action*.

**We believe foresighting is crucial to an organisation's success and the first step we use in our StrategyConnect process** to anticipate how an organisation's external operating environment will change over time.

StrategyConnect focuses on building an adaptive and robust strategy, able to course correct in times of change for effective future growth in a fast-changing world.`,

    content: `In the rapidly changing world of technology, we are experiencing a big transformation. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT and BART has not only revolutionised the way we interact with machines but has also opened the door to a profound partnership between humans and artificial intelligence. In this article, we will delve into the concept of creating "Thinking Partnerships" with LLMs, exploring their role in shaping the future and empowering us to reach new heights of creativity, decision-making and efficiency.

## Evolution of collaborating with technology

From the humble calculator to our dependance on GPS navigation systems and Google search, technology has consistently played a pivotal role in augmenting human capabilities. These earlier innovations that help us in our everyday life, have paved the way for us to use Large Language Model (LLMs), powerful AI-driven tools that have now transcended from assistance to being genuine thinking partners.

LLMs excel at navigating intricate decision-making processes. They are a repository of vast amounts of information, and with the right context they provide valuable insights that contribute to well-informed choices. For instance, Chat GPT's data available is a wide variety of text sources such as books, articles, websites, and more, up until September 2021. Collaborating with LLMs allows for a broader range of data and insights to be considered, it is essentially a form of decision support that can lead to more informed decision-making and optimal outcomes.

## Enhancing creativity and problem solving

LLMs provide the ability to amplify human creativity and build on ways to test our thinking processes. By collaborating with LLMs as a thinking partner, individuals and teams can transcend creative blocks, unleash innovative solutions, and explore novel perspectives that were once beyond reach. The partnership between human imagination and AI innovation holds the potential to redefine the limits of design, invention and large scale problem solving.

Currently most people are using LLMs like GPT, as assistants to automate tasks they already know how to do to achieve better productivity and efficiency. These sorts of tasks include summarising reports, structuring presentations, editing and improving their writing. A more advanced use of LLMs is engaging with it as a Thinking Partner to help with complex issues, where the answer is not yet known, or how to best address it.

We specialise in strategy development and execution to help organisations drive growth. To further push the boundaries of future planning, we have begun teaching clients how to apply LLMs to unknown scenarios. All organisations live in a complex environment and the better an organisation can anticipate how the different sector actors and factors will respond in the future, the more robust their strategy will be.

This is achieved through understanding the external environment and using GPT to help broaden the scope by identifying factors that will shape the business landscape in the next 5 years and beyond, and the implications of how these may change over time. The other area we have built on is using LLMs in scenario planning to develop extreme but plausible scenarios that could otherwise be difficult for individuals to comprehend.

## Efficiency unleashed

As well as the ability to expand our thinking further for future scenarios, by delegating cognitive tasks to LLMs we will see a significant boost in efficiency and productivity. The rapid processing capabilities of these models allow for swift data analysis, research, and problem-solving. **By harnessing their computational prowess, businesses and individuals can achieve more in less time, propelling progress across a multitude of industries.** We refer to this as 'close to zero cost delegation', where processes that previously would take a long time to complete can be augmented with inexpensive tools that effectively make our lives easier, as well as accomplishing the outcome faster.

## Effective Thinking Partnerships with LLMs

Thinking partnerships with LLMs are not a replacement of human intelligence, but rather an enhancement of it. The synergy between human curiosity and AI-driven knowledge leads to empowered learning experiences. Engaging in conversations with LLMs has the ability to broaden horizons, cultivate critical thinking, and nurture lifelong learning. Just like in the case of using a calculator to help solve mathematical equations or GPS to easily discover locations, integrating LLMs can aid us with more complex decision making, allowing us to ultimately be more informed and innovative, in a low-cost, productive way.

Creating thinking partnerships with LLMs brings empowerment through:

- Amplifying creativity
- Enhancing decision-making
- Solving complex problems
- Augmenting expertise
- Efficient data handling

At Waterfield we help organisations strategically focus on being future ready, and are at the forefront of guiding enterprises in effectively harnessing the capabilities of LLMs as thinking partners. Our research and expertise in this evolving area of AI collaboration, allows us to teach clients the skills and insights needed to navigate this dynamic world between human ingenuity and technological innovation. We believe the evolution of collaboration with LLMs becomes an exciting journey of discovery, foresighting and building future possibilities for organisations beyond their current capabilities.

## Start experimenting

We encourage you to start experimenting as LLMs and open AI are set to expand exponentially, and now is the time to get on the learning curve.

If you're interested to know more, get in touch and we will send you a quick start guide on effectively using GPT as a thinking tool.`,

    excerpt: "The importance of external perspective in strategic development.",
    date: "2021-08-26",
    image: "/articles/8.jpg.avif",
    author: "Kevin Nuttall",
    content: `Many traditional strategic planning approaches start with the premise that you can design your future and follow a straight line to this future.

We call this Inside-Out Thinking, which is problematic as the underlying assumptions are:

1. The future can be predicted
2. The external world is static

Neither of these assumptions is correct. Waterfield's approach works on the opposite basis ie. Outside-in which has as its assumptions:

1. The future can not be predicted
2. The world is complex and dynamic

If the COVID pandemic has taught us anything, it should be that this is correct.

Below is a more detailed look at the Outside-in approach to strategy development and strategy execution.

## 1. Outside-in logic

The Outside-in logic recognises that the external world is by far the biggest predictor of an organisation's success and there is a long list of very large organisations and sectors that planned their own demise by ignoring this principle:

- Worldcom
- Nokia
- Kodak
- Taxi industry
- Music industry

Today the pandemic has probably brought this home very clearly to most people. The starting point of the StrategyConnect process is therefore scanning and interpreting the external environment and how to position your organisation to be a viable and valued player. We have found that the collective knowledge of the whole group is the richest source of information for the future scanning process.

The following diagram shows the logical flow back from the external environment analysis.

![Outside-in Planning](/inside-out-planning-1.jpg.avif)

## 2. Progress over precision

Given the speed of change, by the time an organisation has perfected its plan, the external world has changed. We have taken a leaf out of the software industry's playbook and advocate a rough consensus approach and learning by doing. Interestingly, the World Wide Web developers pioneered this philosophy to build and continue to evolve one of the most significant technological advancements of the 21st Century - the internet. See Wired Magazine article below - *"How anarchy works"*.

In practice, I am sure this is exactly how your frontline staff operate every day to deal with the multitude of challenges they face. This agile thinking and approach are equally relevant to planning and executing strategy and means the organisation spends less time planning and more time acting and learning. The Strategy Map then evolves in line with the external environment changes and the organisation's capabilities.

As below, the Strategy Map sits at the nexus of the two cycles and matures over time as the organisation gets better and better at simultaneously scanning the external environment and testing its assumptions rapidly.

![Strategy Map](/inside-out-planning-2.jpg.avif)

## Conclusion

If your organisation is setting its strategy to win, or its BHAGS (Big Hairy Audacious Goals) or any number of Inside-out planning models whilst paying scant regard to the external environment, then our suggestion is that your organisation will struggle to assert its will on the external world, and more likely to fail.

Our strongest recommendation is to recognise that the external world you operate in is many times more powerful and more complex than you can hope to predict or influence. This is not in the least a defeatist attitude, but dealing with reality.

To succeed is accepting the unpredictability of the future, building your best hypothesis, then acting and adapting quickly.

    content: `A number of people believe collaboration is a wonderful idea in theory, although to implement in the real world it takes more time, more resources and more people. This article dispels that notion, highlighting teams collaborating together encourage simplicity and productivity.

## Managing layers of complexity

As the business landscape is becoming more complex, there are more and more layers to manage, such as growing levels of compliance, sustainability challenges, changing demographics, the digital tsunami and the list goes on.

The temptation is to add more layers in your organisation to cope with this onslaught.

For example the risk and compliance committee, the digital transformation team, the corporate social responsibility team, and the quality assurance team.

It is not long before people in your organisation are spending as much time meeting internal requirements as they are on delivering value to your customers.

There is another way. It is called leveraging the collaboration advantage, the more you collaborate, the less resources you need to do your work.

This in turn means:

- Less people
- Less management layers
- Less equipment
- Less time
- Less inventory
- Less working capital

To deliver the same and increased value.

## Smart Simplicity

Yves Morieux elegantly summed up this concept in the following graph in his Ted Talk - 6 rules for smart simplicity.

![Smart Simplicity Graph](/27cf80_ec5f31db235d438b8f2fa90bce1608aa~mv2.png.avif)

On the vertical axis are the resources you need to get work done. On the horizontal access is the degree to which you collaborate with others. Morieux's research suggests the drop in resources needed to do the same work is exponentially smaller.

The conclusion being if you want to increase productivity, do not add more layers, but increase collaboration.

Therefore how you design your organisation structure and processes, should seek to maximise the seamless integration between the teams to deliver customer value.

Fortunately, there are a series of new tools and management approaches that are starting to enable organisations to operate in simpler and faster ways, for example:

1. Managers as facilitators e.g. training managers to focus on empowering and enabling people to work collaboratively

2. Team of teams approach to portfolios of work

3. Collaboration platforms e.g. Slack, Workplace by Facebook, Microsoft Teams

4. Agile frameworks e.g. short 30 min stand up meetings to coordinate and synchronise.

These tools and approaches enable a move to a more collaborative and well-informed working environment; which positively correlates to a more productive and satisfying place to work.

## Summary

In an increasingly more complex world, the old management paradigm of command and control has reached its limits, the new paradigm is collaboration and this ensures people are:

- Connected and committed to the goals of the organisation
- Continually informing and remaining informed about the business
- Dealing with a far simpler organisation with fewer barriers to getting their work done.

We call this the collaboration advantage.`,

    content: `Where is your future?

Here is a quick exercise to demonstrate what I am talking about:

1. Stand up

2. Now point to the future

Most people point in front of them, towards the front right. It is very unlikely you will be pointing behind you. Over the years, we have asked hundreds of people this question and if you have been culturalised in the West, your past present future timeline will most likely be:

- Past = Behind left
- Present = Where you are standing
- Future = Front right

## Why is this relevant?

It is relevant because you can use this spatial orientation to check where you are predominately thinking and hence acting from.

We are unable to change the past, therefore engaging with yesterday's thinking limits your organisation's ability to adapt to the realities of a rapidly changing environment.

To operate today, with your future vision in mind, is the most productive place to be.

At Waterfield, we call this Outcome Thinking - famously captured by Steven Covey's succinct statement "Start with the end in mind."

To further experiment with this we have recently asked large groups of participants at the beginning of a session to point to where their thinking is on a complex issue. We usually observe people pointing to the past, behind them. After an interactive, facilitated process using outcomes thinking we ask again, and the whole group sees a shift to pointing towards the future. Focusing on where they want to be going is a more productive and a more motivating place to operate from.

![Orientation Diagram](/27cf80_76ad525bbec3465984ef3a52c18cfc8a~mv2.png.avif)

This diagram shows the areas you can pay attention to;

1. Outcomes

2. Planning

3. Details

4. Problems

5. Drama

Using this approach, consider where:

- you predominantly operate from: past, present or future?
- your team predominantly operates from?
- your organisation predominantly operates from?
- your sector predominantly operates from?

This allows insight into the overall orientation for thinking in the past, present or future, and where you would like to shift your awareness to.

If your answer is heavily influenced by the past, then this is the time to shine as a leader and paint the picture of an inspiring future and engage:

- Yourself
- Your team
- Your organisation
- Your sector

In designing and creating a new and better future.`,

    content: `The starting point for strategic thinking should always be the external environment as it does not matter how big or small your business is, external factors will always have a far greater impact on your organisation's success than your internal issues. An analysis or scan of your organisation's external environment is critical at the earliest possible stage of strategic planning.

An external environment scan as part of the planning process must be carried out objectively. CEO's often have a vision and strong sense of where they want to take the organisation strategically, but it is vital that the external scanning is done with an open and honest approach as it is these external factors that will inevitably shape the future.

Leaders must be open to the notion that today's business model will not survive in the future, strategic planning is about making the changes ahead of the need, rather than trying to make a late and massive step change which often does not work. This explains a long list of high-profile failures eg Kodak, Nokia, Blockbuster, Worldcom, Borders Bookshops, Compaq.

## Kodak Australia

An example that sticks in my mind is Kodak's film production factory in Victoria, Australia. Despite winning multiple quality awards and tens of millions of Government assistance; Kodak was not able to push back the tide towards digital despite its size. They failed to foresee the best product/market fit.

In Kodak's case, their customers still had a strong demand and desire to capture images and memories, however, they were agnostic to the media or device. What was once described as a 'Kodak Moment' is now described as 'selfie' or 'insta' worthy. Ironically, an engineer employed by Kodak, Mr Sasson, invented the digital camera in 1975 and Kodak tried to keep it hidden as "Kodak's marketing department was not interested in it as they were concerned it would eat away at the company's film sales."

'Companies that fail to embrace change and reorganise their approach accordingly will, regardless of any prior success, be swept away. Learning only from success creates a deeper problem: drawing conclusions only from available or convenient data will systematically prejudice results and long-term thinking. Ultimately, it pays to study failure and learn from it. Only by doing so, can we prevent similar failures in our own organisations.' David Chancellor concluded in an [article about learning from spectacular corporate failures.](https://www.managers.org.uk/knowledge-and-insights/case-study/four-companies-that-failed-spectacularly-and-the-lessons-of-their-premature-demise/)

## Future Scanning

In Waterfield's StrategyConnect planning approach, we call this process 'future scanning' and we start by interviewing our clients to understand all the 'actors' in their ecosystem including;

- customers
- suppliers
- competitors
- regulators

These are independent actors (ie, all seeking to optimise their world, not yours). This is the start of understanding what changes or adaptations each of these actors will make over the next three to five years.

Once you have determined what the future will demand of your organisation, you conduct a gap analysis between your current capabilities and what will be required to deliver the required future set of products and services. For commercial organisation's we generally take a three-year horizon.

We then extract the trends that will positively and negatively impact the organisation and plot these trends in a 10-year wave analysis to look at the confluence of trends in three years time.

Working out what that anticipated future will demand and what outcomes the organisation will need to have in three years time to prosper. This then forms the strategic outcomes of the organisations 'Strategy Map' which will form the basis of your organisation's strategy.

## Understanding and Assessing Product/Market Fit

It is important to note that, determining 'product/market fit' is a completely objective 'outside looking in' exercise and has nothing to do with what the organisation currently does. According to Jeffrey P. Bezos, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Amazon in his letter to shareholders, this is about having an "Obsessive customer focus".

Painful as it is often is; the future can have little to do with what your organisation currently is good at, eg. Kodak. However to quote Amazon again, "The outside world will push you into irrelevance if you won't or can't embrace powerful trends quickly. If you fight them, you are probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind."

Whilst the example of Kodak was a catastrophic failure in foreseeing a shift and not adjusting to it, there have been some very positive results when businesses have foreseen a shift and adjusted their strategy accordingly.

Starting with a future scanning session is a good way to future proof your organisation against possible threats or changes in the operating environment. The next step is to determine what the action priority areas are in the next 12 months to realise this new future, and then, of course, it is time to act.

    content: `A client recently asked us to review their strategy development and execution process. Although we pointed out that we were not exactly unbiased arbiters, having been their strategy facilitators for the past 5 years, they were confident we would conduct a competent job.

To ensure we were as objective as possible, we developed the following 5 questions for the research. These questions were asked from their perspective:

**How well did we anticipate the future and set the right goals?**

**How well did we build capacity to realise our goals?**

**How well did we adapt our strategy as issues emerged?**

**How well are we now positioned to compete?**

**Are we currently working on the right things to remain competitive?**

The conclusion for this client was that they had scored a 'B'. Interestingly, it was likened to getting a B at high school and, as they are now going into far more complex market conditions, getting a B at university was going to require a significant lift in focus and effort on developing and implementing their strategy.

The definitions of the grading scale are below. How well does your organisation score?

## Grading Scale:

**5** - Outstanding (leading the pack and able to continue to pull away from your competitors)

**4** - Good (could have done better, but a very creditable effort)

**3** - Average (no better or worse than your competitors but subject to shocks)

**2** - Failed (losing ground to competitors, losing key people and partners; in need of a step change)

**1** - Spectacular failure (not just failed but did it in the worst possible way; CPA comes to mind)

The context of each question is explained below. Tally up your score to get a better understanding of how you are tracking.

## Question 1. How well did we anticipate the future and set the right goals?

You cannot predict the future but you can make informed guesses ('hypotheses' in consulting speak). In reality, your organisation controls very little. You are but one independent element in a very complex soup. Ingredients in this soup include geo-political forces, climate change, regulatory changes, demographic changes, digital tsunami, new left field competitors and the list goes on.

Your organisation's strategic imperative is to be ready and able to deliver value to your customers (or beneficiaries) now and into the future. In this complex and ever-changing environment, how well did your organisation go in the past, in setting goals that ensured you were relevant to your current customers?

**Score 1 to 5**

## Question 2. How well did we build capacity to realise our goals?

Unless you are a startup, a full 90% or more of your resources will be allocated to running the core operating business. New strategic initiatives get starved of vital resources and focus to succeed. [Christensen famously called it the 'Innovation dilemma'.](http://www.claytonchristensen.com/books/the-innovators-dilemma/) You know you need to invest in the future but your 'business as usual' model consumes all of the available resources and, in fact, most already feel under-resourced.

It takes immense discipline to invest in the future in any meaningful way. It is a bit like getting fit; you tell yourself, there's always tomorrow.

Having observed thousands of companies execute their strategies over the years, there is clear evidence the successful ones conscientiously carve out the time and resources to consistently work on building capacity for the future.

How well does your company do with the resources allocated to strategic initiatives?

**Score 1 to 5**

## Question 3. How well did we adapt our strategy as issues emerged?

As previously discussed in our recent article - [The Tipping Point of Complexity](/articles/tipping-point-of-complexity) - our world is complex and by definition, unpredictable.

To paraphrase the famous Prussian General, Helmuth von Moltke, "no plan survives contact with the enemy".

Like the modern military's strategy, you have the commander's intent but then the ground commander makes the decisions based on the realities of the emerging situation. This is a local and agile approach that is dealing with the realities as they arise and adapting without losing the intent of the strategy. For example, under this approach, there would have been no Charge of the Light Brigade.

This agile approach to strategy means, your strategy is 'up for grabs' every 90 days. This means stepping back from the execution process and taking an objective look at progress; testing your hypothesis against what you are learning from the field. You then accelerate the experiments that are getting cut-through and change or abandon failing experiments.

How agile or adaptive is your organisation to external changes?

**Score 1 to 5**

## Question 4. How well are we now positioned to compete?

Is your organisation losing ground to more aggressive competitors, or are you gaining market share and gaining meaningful traction in new markets? This question can be answered by answering the subset of questions about your customers and your product/market fit:

Are you able to charge a premium because of leading innovation?

Are your customers loyal?

Are you able to attract and retain the new talent that you need to grow?

Companies that read the 'tea leaves' well and respond proactively perform better and become resume trophies for talented people.

How well are you currently positioned to win in your target markets?

**Score 1 to 5**

## Question 5. Are you currently working on the right things to remain competitive?

Strategy development and execution is not an event, it is a continuous process that is never 'done'. Doing well in the past is no guarantee for the future. Just ask the 95% of the fund managers that fail to outperform the index over a 5-year term.

The question here is, are you resting on your laurels? Is there a continued sense of urgency about maintaining the strategic momentum? [Andy Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove); having nearly buried Intel in the early days by ignoring the Japanese threat of cheaper and better ROM chips, coined the phrase, "only the paranoid survive".

Does your organisation have a sense of urgency and a healthy level of paranoia?

**Your score 1 to 5**

## How did you Score?

Add up your scores to the 5 questions. The ranking is:

**21 to 25 = A**

**16 to 20 = B**

**11 to 15 = C**

**6 to 10 = D**

**1 to 5 = E**

How well did you go? Even if you got a 'good grade' remember our client's conclusion - a B today is no guarantee of a B tomorrow.

We have developed a rapid collaborative process to obtain a consensus rating or grade on your organisation's strategy performance in less than 60 minutes.

    content: `When working in large organisations, invariably you will be dealing with a large number of independent actors. There is a direct correlation between complexity and the number of stakeholders vying for their own ideal outcome. This is why traditional project planning for an uncertain future only gives you a warm feeling and is fundamentally useless.

The catalyst for this thinking is a number of our clients have sought to have a simple linear project plan to the future (the underlying assumption is you can predict the future). In a complex system, rather than a linear approach, leaders need to allow solutions to emerge and evolve.

Our sense was with 5 or more independent actors in an organisation's ecosystems, you have a complex system; which means there are emergent behaviours that are unpredictable.

An actor might be the customers, the competitors, the regulator, the community etc.

Clearly, all organisations have more than 5 independent actors in their ecosystems therefore all live in a complex and unpredictable world.

The reason is each actor is seeking to optimise their world (not yours) so the interplay between all these optimisation games creates the complexity. For example, while your organisation is trying to maximise its revenue your customers are trying to minimise their costs.

Our research and experience uncovered the tipping point for complexity to be between 4 and 5 independent actors. It is important to understand the framework in which decisions are being made, as this will dictate the appropriate method and planning models that should be implemented and whether it should be adaptive or predictive.

In Harvard Business Review's article, A Leader's Framework for Decision Making by [David J. Snowden](https://hbr.org/search?term=david+j.+snowden) and [Mary E. Boone](https://hbr.org/search?term=mary+e.+boone) a distinction is made between four domains:

1. Simple

2. Complicated

3. Complex

4. Chaotic

We argue that developing an organisation's strategy, fits in the Complex domain, which "is the realm of "unknown unknowns," and it is the domain to which much of contemporary business has shifted.

In complex environments you have 'emergent behaviour' that can not be predicted, for example new entrants are coming into the market, existing players are adapting or failing, customers are learning how to optimise their situation. Given all these concurrent changes it is not possible to predict how this will play out. The best approach in this environment of "unknown unknowns" is to anticipate, form a hypothesis, act, learn and adapt; which is the approach used by Waterfield's StrategyConnect 90 Day Action Learning Cycle.

The article talks to the [Cynefin Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) which has influenced our work. Using the Cynefin framework can help executives sense which context they are in so that they can not only make better decisions but also avoid the problems that arise when their preferred management style causes them to make mistakes.

## *An Extract from Article

**Complex Contexts: The Domain of Emergence**

In a complicated context, at least one right answer exists. In a complex context, however, right answers can't be ferreted out. It's like the difference between, say, a Ferrari and the Brazilian rainforest. Ferraris are complicated machines, but an expert mechanic can take one apart and reassemble it without changing a thing. The car is static, and the whole is the sum of its parts. The rainforest, on the other hand, is in constant flux—a species becomes extinct, weather patterns change, an agricultural project reroutes a water source—and the whole is far more than the sum of its parts.

This is the realm of "unknown unknowns," and it is the domain to which much of contemporary business has shifted.Most situations and decisions in organizations are complex because some major change—a bad quarter, a shift in management, a merger or acquisition—introduces unpredictability and flux. In this domain, we can understand why things happen only in retrospect. Instructive patterns, however, can emerge if the leader conducts experiments that are safe to fail. That is why, instead of attempting to impose a course of action, leaders must patiently allow the path forward to reveal itself. They need to probe first, then sense, and then respond. There is a scene in the film Apollo 13 when the astronauts encounter a crisis ("Houston, we have a problem") that moves the situation into a complex domain. A group of experts is put in a room with a mishmash of materials—bits of plastic and odds and ends that mirror the resources available to the astronauts in flight. Leaders tell the team: This is what you have; find a solution or the astronauts will die. None of those experts knew a priori what would work. Instead, they had to let a solution emerge from the materials at hand. And they succeeded. (Conditions of scarcity often produce more creative results than conditions of abundance.)

Another example comes from YouTube. The founders could not possibly have predicted all the applications for streaming video technology that now exist. Once people started using YouTube creatively, however, the company could support and augment the emerging patterns of use. YouTube has become a popular platform for expressing political views, for example. The company built on this pattern by sponsoring a debate for presidential hopefuls with video feeds from the site.

As in the other contexts, leaders face several challenges in the complex domain. Of primary concern is the temptation to fall back into traditional command-and-control management styles—to demand fail-safe business plans with defined outcomes. Leaders who don't recognise that a complex domain requires a more experimental mode of management may become impatient when they don't seem to be achieving the results they were aiming for. They may also find it difficult to tolerate failure, which is an essential aspect of experimental understanding. If they try to over control the organisation, they will preempt the opportunity for informative patterns to emerge. Leaders who try to impose order in a complex context will fail, but those who set the stage, step back a bit, allow patterns to emerge, and determine which ones are desirable will succeed. They will discern many opportunities for innovation, creativity, and new business models.

    content: `Many years ago, we used to have three steps in our facilitation model:

1. Current state

2. Preferred state

3. Actions

However, with these 3 steps we found that at the Action stage, we regularly got ambushed by a laundry list!

By this we mean, rather than the group remaining focused on the preferred future state, they dished up a long list of 'business as usual' ideas and pet projects.

These tended to be unrelated to creating the preferred future state and if enacted would result in more of the same current state problems and issues.

The reasons for people defaulting to a laundry list are understandable.

These are:

a) known and comfortable

b) protects their job

c) is a passion

d) led by dominant people

However, if these actions do not create the aspired future or address changes in the external environment, then they are pointless activities.

## Generating options for your preferred state

To resolve this conundrum, we introduced a fourth step - option generation.

The four steps are now:

1. Current state

2. Preferred state

3. Options

4. Actions

This options step ensures the focus is on creating the preferred state.

Here is an example to help show how adding the options step opens up possibilities.

**Three-step model:**

Current state: I am unfit

Preferred state: I want to be fit and healthy

Action: I will join a spin class

**Four-step model:**

Current state: I am unfit

Preferred state: I want to be fit and healthy

Options: Diet, exercise, sleep a minimum of 7 hours a night, manage stress levels

Action: Adopt the 5:2 fast diet, join a spin class, take mini-holidays every quarter, establish a sleep routine

You will note that the spin class also made the action list in the four-step model but there is a difference. If I hate spin class, the broad option was to exercise. Rather than scrap the whole plan, I just refer to the options list of exercise and choose again eg. swimming, running, cycling, kayaking, walking, gym etc.

What the options step does is:

a) retains the focus on the preferred outcome

b) maintains the integrity of the plan and allows you to experiment with different actions

c) stops you being ambushed by a laundry list as you can eliminate things as they are not on the options list that will help create the preferred state

For those of you interested in how to generate options, the following are some distinctions that will help.

Options are the domain of all possibilities, a continuum from the realistic and practical to the outlandish and improbable

Getting groups to stretch to the outlandish and improbable end of the continuum allows groups to be more creative.

For example:

'Get fit' extreme option generating might include;

- Get a body transplant
- Pay my personal trainer to exercise on my behalf
- Only have friends who are elite athletes
- Get a younger, fitter, healthy spouse

Working back down the continuum might include:

- Buy a dog and walk it every day
- Change my job so I am mobile all day
- Get a workout buddy
- Limit junk food during the week

Getting a group to stretch their thinking will ensure:

- They remain future focused
- Have some fun and be more creative
- Consider more options and don't jump to the first one

## Investing in meaningful actions

In summary, people and groups like solving problems, though may not spend significant time in thinking beyond the current state or boundaries. This means their actions can lack the rigour or effectiveness to realise their goals.

Your role as a leader is to ensure the actions a group are investing in are robust and will maximise their chances of success.

We have found by introducing the additional logic step of broad option generation has significant benefits. I encourage you to try it!`,

    content: `What is Negativity Bias?

Your brain is hardwired to go negative. Evolutionary psychologists would argue that this feature allowed our species to survive; for example the guy who patted the saber tooth tiger is no longer in the gene pool.

However, in most situations today we no longer need to be in survival mode, yet we carry this hardwired negativity bias. It is this bias that keeps people and groups stuck in the now and the current set of problems.

There has been much research on Brain Negativity Bias.

> "Neuropsychologist Rick Hanson, PhD, University of California, Berkeley, explains how our amygdala uses about two-thirds of its neurons to detect negativity and then quickly stores it into long-term memory. Imagine this, two thirds of your emotions and motivation regulator is designed to focus primarily on the negative."

As Albert Einstein is quoted as saying "We can not solve our problems with the same thinking that we used to create them."

## Using Outcome Thinking as a tool

Outcome Thinking is a circuit breaker to the current negative thinking. It can be as simple as asking "What would it look like if it worked?"

Having asked thousands of groups this question, I am always interested in the delay before they can answer the question. My hypothesis is they have never fired a single positive neuron about the subject before.

Once the group have articulated a desired future state, they are in a more productive place to generate options and own the actions.

Waterfield have captured this approach in a process called the Four Seasons which we use extensively and train people in through the RapidConsensus Workshop.

![Four Seasons Process](/27cf80_e749dd08cb6444e59fbd4baab5afa374~mv2.png.avif)

The Four Seasons are:

**Season 1:** A cathartic moan and groan about the current scenario

**Season 2:** Articulating the preferred outcome

**Season 3:** Generating options to realise the preferred outcome

**Season 4:** Developing actions to deliver the desired result

So the next time you or your group get stuck, ask the positive outcome based question "What would it look like if it worked?" to circuit break the brain's natural tendency to stay negative.

    content: `My mentor used to say 'Facilitation is about helping unequal human beings to be equally human.'

In different contexts we are unequal in many ways; by position, by age, by experience, by knowledge…however we are all equally human.

The best dialogue comes when people stop hiding behind their roles and start talking on the same level. This is where high order outcomes and decisions can be realised.

To create this level playing field, people need to be physically close enough to effectively interact with each other.

## The Proximity Test:

If people are not sitting close enough to 'high five' each other they will probably not act like constructive adults. A good test is when you reach your arms out, if you can touch the fingertips of all the other people at your table, you are at a distance that you can now have a constructive conversation. This is our observation based on facilitating over 3000 people per year.

It is an interesting little experiment to try. Without this proximity, effective human dialogue breaks down. This means most large meeting room tables are a disaster for human to human interaction.

This demystifies the reason why it is so hard to get people to have a constructive dialogue and more importantly, dialogue that leads to good quality decisions.

> "Without this proximity, effective and constructive human dialogue breaks down."

We firmly believe the "Smartest person in the room is the room" and by creating a level playing field you build a collaborative environment where each individual feels engaged and as a group you are able to gain consensus quickly.

## Engaging Large Groups:

So how do you achieve a constructive dialogue with large groups and more importantly, dialogue that leads to high-quality decisions?

Start with the simple art of room configuration. Surprising the standard room set ups that hinder collaborative outcomes include board rooms, U-shaped discussion panels, large round tables, large square tables and the list goes on. This means most large meeting room tables are a detractor for human to human interaction.

The way we overcome this is to break larger groups into small clusters of typically 5 to 7 people seated facing each other at smaller tables.

With 25 years of research and experience, the table of choice is a standard Trestle table. Nothing fancy just a simple, narrow rectangle, under 2 metres.

For a group of 20 people attending a workshop, this would be 4 tables of 5 people per table fanned down the long side of the room. The largest group of people we have successfully facilitated in this style is 250.

Questions are posed to the whole room and each table discusses the same question. A facilitator at the front of the room then records the consensus position.

    content: `Waterfield works across many different sectors in any one year and we are increasingly noticing the emergence of overarching trends affecting all organisations. We are calling these 'MetaTrends'.

In order to better understand these trends and their impact, industry leaders and thinkers were invited to a brainstorming session facilitated by Waterfield.

The hypothesis was that if you can identify and understand how a certain trend is affecting a specific industry, you can see the potential effect on others in the future. The session was designed to crowdsource this idea and gain insights into different industries simultaneously, harnessing the collective intelligence of a group we like to call the 'Free Radicals'.

'Free Radicals' was introduced as part of Waterfield's approach and aimed to tap into the collective intelligence of groups to solve complex issues and to generate innovative ideas for the future. For the Free Radicals, it is an opportunity to work with like-minded talented people across different industries, providing insights that may not be as readily available on their own.

In this session, the Free Radicals were tasked with completing the 'MetaTrends Periodic Table' - named after [Mendeleev's brilliant model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table) published in 1869. Mendeleev's model left 'holes' for yet to be discovered elements and as science progressed, his predictions were proven correct.

It is these insights about 'holes' in the MetaTrends Periodic Table that will allow organisations and individuals to understand how they may be affected in the future. The MetaTrends Periodic Table was divided into industries taken from the Australian Bureau of Statistics against predetermined trends - the Free Radicals began to populate the table with often unknown disrupters with varying degrees of maturity.

In his book, [The Fourth Revolution](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/06/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-by-klaus-schwab-review), Klaus Schwab writes "For some companies, capturing new frontiers of value may consist of developing new businesses in adjacent segments, while for others, it is about identifying shifting pockets of value in existing sectors."

It is these insights about 'holes' in the MetaTrends Periodic Table that will allow organisations and individuals to understand how they may be affected in the future.

> Decision-makers are too often caught in traditional, linear (and non-disruptive) thinking or too absorbed by immediate concerns to think strategically about the forces of disruption and innovation shaping our future.

— Klaus Schwab, The Fourth Revolution

This was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of how we can understand the changes that are affecting our world, and we are confident that soon we will have a working model that analyses current and future trends that could become a powerful tool in shaping business models both now and in the future, ensuring a 'future ready organisation'.`,
